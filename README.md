Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a dynamic field at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. It empowers machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful. As we increasingly interact with technology through text and speech, NLP plays a pivotal role in enabling effective communication between humans and machines.

In this notebook, we will explore fundamental NLP tasks, including:

* Tokenization: Breaking down text into smaller units to facilitate analysis.
* Stopword Removal: Filtering out common words to focus on significant terms.
* Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: Identifying the grammatical structure of sentences.
* Named Entity Recognition (NER): Extracting and classifying key entities in the text.
* Sentiment Analysis: Determining the emotional tone of the content.
* Text Generation: Creating coherent text based on prompts.
* Summarization: Condensing long texts into concise summaries.
  
Through practical examples and hands-on coding, we will gain insights into how these techniques enhance our understanding and processing of natural language. Letâ€™s dive into the world of NLP!
